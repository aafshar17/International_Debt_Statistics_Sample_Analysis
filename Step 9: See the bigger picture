-- The previous result shows that there are 6 debt indicators for which all of the countries in this dataset have
-- incurred debt. This is important since it highlights that these countries are likely suffering from a common economic
--malady. There is more to uncover but this is a great starting point.  

-- Lastly, it would provide further context to find the maximum amount of debt 
-- across the indicators along with the respective country names. This is one possible way to 
-- identify other economic issues in the different countries.
