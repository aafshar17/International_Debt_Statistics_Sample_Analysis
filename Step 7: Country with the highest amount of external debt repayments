-- The previous result shows that debt indicator DT.AMT.DLXF.CD is the indicator witht he highest average debt amount. 
-- As the indicator_name column points out, this category is comprised of repayments of long-term debts. It would be 
-- interesting to look more into this category for understanding what projects are being funded, etc.

-- One thing that stands out prominently is that the first two indicators have much larger average debt amounts than the
-- indicators thereafter. Perhaps this might mean that these are the most critical categories in which countries owe their
-- external debt. 

-- Let's explore which country owes the World Bank the highest average amount of debt in this category (DT.AMT.DLXF.CD).
