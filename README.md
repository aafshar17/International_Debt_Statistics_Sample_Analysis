# International_Debt_Statistics_Sample_Analysis using SQL and Power BI
Countries reach out to the World Bank for loans to support development and other projects in their countries. 

The purpose of this project is to use PostgreSQL to analyze international debt data that is collected by the World Bank. By doing so, one can provide valuable insights into global debt trends and particular points of interest. Results are verified via PowerQuery and transformed into a simple, mobile-friendly dashboard using Power BI.
